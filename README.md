# Basket-ball trainer

Basket-ball trainer is an application to improve your dribble. During a game you have to dribble with one hand and touch a circle with the other hand. The game helps you to switch from one hand to the other one.

You have 30seconds to touch the most circle with your hands.

Have fun!
